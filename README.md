### Python

The python code for the pre-trained transformer model approach can be found in Python/entity-resolution-clust.ipybn. We chose to use a jupyter notebook to clearly lay out our experiments in a step-by-step manner. To run the notebook, first create the conda environmnet with all necessary packages by running `conda env create -f environment.yml` from the Python directory. Then you can run the jupyter notebook using the `ent-res-cons` environment.
